# Audit Analytics

In this repository are example audit analytic tests using the python ecosystem. 

## Python dependencies: 

Python 2.7
pyodbc
pywin32 (for outlook email)
pandas

I recommend installing Anaconda https://www.continuum.io/downloads as it provides a complete environment with the dependcies already installed and does not require without a lot of manual installation.

## R dependencies:

The R program as written installs the three required dependencies, RODBC, xlsx, sendmailR through the use of a library named pacman. So, the only manual installing you need to do is when you turn on R for the first time, run the following code:
install.packages("pacman")
The above code installs pacman, which installs and loads the other libraries when you run the program.
